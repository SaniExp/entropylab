# Contributing to EntropyLab

EntropyLab is small on purpose; its value comes from being auditable. Read this
before opening a pull request.

## 1. EntropyLab does not generate entropy

It converts entropy the *user* supplies — dice rolls, coin flips, hex, seed
phrases, private keys — into wallet recovery information. It is a calculator,
not a key generator.

The reason is trust: the user must be able to see, verify, and reproduce every
step of a derivation from randomness they produced themselves. The moment the
tool manufactures randomness, "I verified the output" stops being true.

**Will be closed, not merged:**

- "Generate key / seed / entropy" buttons.
- `Math.random()` or `crypto.getRandomValues()` used as a *source of secret
  material* (keys, seeds, passphrases, salts, defaults that end up in private
  material).
- Auto-filled, pre-generated, or server-supplied randomness.

**In policy:** deterministic transformations of user input (same input → same
output), user-typed randomness, and fixed published test vectors.

**The one exception (already in the code):** the Heads/Tails control uses
`crypto.getRandomValues()` only to pick which *equivalent* die face to display
(1–3 = Heads, 4–6 = Tails). The number is discarded on render and carries zero
entropy. New exceptions: argue them in an issue first, never in a pull request.

## 2. Keep it simple

- The smallest change that fixes the problem is the right change.
- No unreviewed dependencies: exact versions in `package.json`, integrity
  hashes in the committed `package-lock.json`, installed with `npm ci`.
- No frameworks, transpilers, or bundler abstractions beyond
  `scripts/build.mjs`.
- Delete code rather than add it.
- Optimise for the auditor, not for elegance. If a change needs a paragraph of
  justification, it is too clever.

## 3. No network egress

The tool runs air-gapped and must not phone home: no `fetch`, WebSocket,
remote `<img>`/`<script>`/`<link>`, fonts, CDNs, or analytics. Everything the
app loads must be same-origin or inlined at build time, and the headless
browser test that asserts this must stay green.

## 4. Build and artifact

- The final build artifact is **`entropylab.html`** — a single self-contained
  HTML file with no runtime requirements (server, network, storage, or
  extensions). Any change must keep this true.
- Edit sources in `src/`, never the build output. `entropylab.html` is
  generated, git-ignored, and not committed.
- CI rebuilds from `src/`, proves the output is byte-for-byte reproducible, and
  publishes it to the `pages` branch and GitHub Pages.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/w-s-bitcoin/entropylab.git && cd entropylab
node --version   # >= 20.19
npm ci
npm run build    # src/ → entropylab.html
npm test
```

Useful commands (same as CI): `npm run build`, `npm run verify`,
`npm run test:validate`, `npm run test:browser` (needs local Firefox),
`npm run ci`.

## 5. Working agreements

- **Versioning:** declared once in `package.json`; `README.md` must match it (a
  test enforces this). Bump only when asked.
- **Docs:** user-facing or security-model changes require `README.md` /
  `SECURITY.md` updates in the same pull request.
- **Tests:** new or changed behaviour needs a test; published vectors (BIP39,
  BIP32, Bitcoin Core) are preferred. Never weaken, skip, or delete an existing
  test to make CI pass — if it is wrong, say why.
- **Pull requests:** small and focused, one change each. No drive-by
  reformatting or refactors. Describe what and why, and list the commands you
  ran. Comments explain intent and security reasoning, not the code.
- **Not accepted:** anything violating sections 1 or 3; license/authorship
  changes (the software is public domain); changes that obscure what the
  compiled `entropylab.html` does.
- **Security issues:** report privately via GitHub Security Advisories
  ([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)), not as public issues.
- **License:** public domain ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). By opening a pull request
  you confirm your contribution can be public domain; if not, open an issue
  instead.

## A final sanity check

1. Does this keep EntropyLab a calculator that never invents entropy?
2. Does the app stay silent on the network?
3. Is the output still a single self-contained `entropylab.html`?
4. Is it smaller, or at least no bigger, than it was?
5. Did you rebuild, keep docs/version in sync, and commit no generated files?
6. Could an auditor follow the change in one pass?

If yes to all six, send it. Thanks.
